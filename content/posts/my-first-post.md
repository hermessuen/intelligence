The general purpose of this site, and this group, is to understand intelligence. We wish to contribute to a societal level understanding of what that is, and how it can be instantiated in non-biological forms. However, this is simply to provide the three of us a worthwile goal. What we are really concerned with, is the path of learning and the lessons along the way. Regardless of the result of our efforts, we are simply excited to embark on a lifelong journey of curiosity and exploration, and in some sense, are fulfilling our goal every time we contribute to this collection of knowledge.
